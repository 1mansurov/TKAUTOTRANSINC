        <h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
        <p>TK Auto Trans Inc.: ‘TK Auto Trans,’ ‘TK,’ ‘we,’ ‘us,’ or ‘our’ refers to TK Auto Trans Inc., which is fully licensed and bonded, meeting all necessary requirements mandated by the USDOT (MC 820793) and fully compliant with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).

            SHIPPER RESPONSIBILITIES
            Accurate Information: The Shipper must provide accurate pickup and drop-off locations.
            Vehicle Preparation: The Shipper is responsible for preparing the vehicle(s) for shipping, including securing loose parts, removing or deactivating toll passes, and ensuring the vehicle has no more than a half tank of fuel (1/4 tank preferred). All personal belongings should be removed unless prior arrangements are made.
           Inspection: The Shipper and Consignee must perform a thorough inspection of the vehicle(s) before and after delivery and carefully review the Bill of Lading before signing.
            Compliance: The Shipper warrants compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
            Cleaning: The Shipper is responsible for cleaning the exterior of the vehicle(s) to allow for proper inspection. Skipping this step may impact the initial inspection and could nullify any future damage claims.
            ONLINE QUOTES AND BOOKING
            Estimate: The estimate provided through our online instant quote calculator is for informational purposes only and is not binding. The accuracy of the estimate depends on the information provided by the Shipper and is valid for 30 days. A representative will contact the Shipper to confirm details.
            Agreement: Actual services and terms will be determined in a separate written agreement.
            VEHICLE OWNERSHIP AND AUTHORIZATION
            Ownership Confirmation: The Shipper confirms they are the legal owner of the vehicle(s) being transported or have been duly authorized by the legal owner to enter into this Agreement.
            Authorization: By signing this Agreement, either physically or electronically, the Shipper authorizes TK Auto Trans Inc. (Carrier) and its agents to operate and transport the vehicle(s) from the specified origin to the specified destination by any mode.
            DOOR-TO-DOOR SERVICE
            The Carrier will get as close to the stated address as legally and safely possible. If necessary, due to local restrictions (e.g., low-hanging trees, narrow streets, weight restrictions, steep hills, or residential restrictions), the Shipper agrees to meet the Carrier at a nearby accessible area for pickup and/or delivery.
            VEHICLE CONTENTS AND PERSONAL BELONGINGS
            Prohibited Items: The vehicle must be free of any items that are prohibited, including firearms, alcohol, hazardous materials, contraband, household goods, or illegal substances.
            Inspection: Vehicles are subject to inspection by the DOT and/or State Police. If prohibited items are found, the Shipper will be responsible for any fines, delays, or additional costs incurred.

            PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
            The Shipper and Consignee are jointly liable for all shipment charges, including any costs of collection, such as court costs and attorney fees, with interest accruing at 1.5% per month or 18% per year.
            DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
            The Consignee must be present at the scheduled delivery point at the specified time. If not, a $100 per day storage fee could apply. The Carrier is not liable for non-use charges, such as auto rentals, due to delays or damages.
            ADDITIONAL FEES FOR INOPERABLE VEHICLES
            Additional fees will apply for inoperable vehicles. If a vehicle becomes inoperable during transport, charges for any necessary equipment (e.g., wreckers, roll-backs, forklifts) will be assessed. If the vehicle is inoperable or oversized (dual or oversized wheels, extra-large racks, lifted, limo, etc.), the Shipper must inquire about extra charges. If TK Auto Trans Inc. is not advised of inoperable or oversized/modified vehicles prior to pickup, all extra charges must be paid in cash or by money order to the Carrier upon delivery.
            VANDALISM AND INSURANCE
            Your vehicle has limited coverage by our insurance while under our care, custody and control. We are not liable for the non-stock contents and would fall back on the individuals’ personal insurance in the event such incidents occurred. Nor are we to be held liable for any vandalism as a result of attempts to liberate/steal any contents of the vehicle. The Shipper agrees that their insurance has primary responsibility in these circumstances.
            PAYMENT TERMS
            Payment for transport is due at or prior to delivery without exceptions, unless other arrangements are made beforehand.
            DELIVERY TIMES
            Delivery times are not guaranteed. All delivery dates are estimates of normal deliveries. The Carrier does not agree to transport the shipment in time for any particular market or event and will not be responsible for damages caused by unavoidable delays. There are no guarantees, expressed or implied, regarding delivery times or dates.
            VEHICLE PREPARATION
            The Shipper is responsible for preparing the vehicle for shipment, including securing loose parts and removing or deactivating toll passes. The Shipper is responsible for 100% of any toll charges incurred during transport. Vehicles must be tendered to the Carrier in good running condition (unless otherwise noted) with no more than a half tank of fuel (preferably 1/4 tank).
            The Shipper must disarm any alarm system installed in the vehicle or provide proper instructions for this purpose. In the event the alarm sounds and there are no keys or instructions to turn it off, the Carrier may silence the alarm by any means.
            SPECIAL VEHICLES
            Additional charges apply for oversized or modified vehicles. If not disclosed prior to pickup, extra fees must be paid in cash or by money order upon delivery. Oversized vehicles include those with dual wheels, extra-large racks, or lift kits.
            RIGHT TO REJECT ORDERS
            TK Auto Trans Inc. reserves the right to reject or cancel any order at any time for any reason without recourse.
            TRANSPORT CONDITIONS
            Vehicles will be loaded forward or backward, on top or on the bottom of the trailer. No specific placement on the trailer is guaranteed to any customer. The driver has full discretion, based on load needs and the delivery schedule, on how and where vehicles will be loaded on the trailer. We will not knowingly misload a car based on our knowledge of new car manufacturer loading/unloading and tie down procedures.
            INITIAL INSPECTION AT PICKUP
            At the time of pickup, the Shipper and Carrier will both carefully inspect the exterior of the vehicle for pre-existing damage, which will be recorded on the Bill of Lading, either by paper or electronic device. Both the Carrier and the Shipper will sign and receive a copy of the Bill of Lading.
            INSPECTION AT DELIVERY
            Upon delivery, the Consignee and the Carrier will inspect the vehicle for any damage incurred during transit. They will acknowledge the vehicle’s condition, and the Consignee will sign and receive a final copy of the Bill of Lading. Any damage must be noted on the Bill of Lading at the time of delivery.
            CLAIMS PROCESS
            Damage Claims: Claims for damage must be made in writing within 24 hours of delivery via email to info@tkautotrans.com. Any damage must be noted on the Bill of Lading at the time of delivery. Claims for hidden damage (damage not visible without lifting the vehicle) must be made within 48 hours of delivery. The burden of proof for hidden damage lies with the party making the claim, who must show that the damage did not exist prior to the Carrier’s receipt of the vehicle. Hidden damage must be documented, and photo evidence of the vehicle’s condition must be provided. Pictures and two estimates for repair should be sent as soon as possible. All claims may be subject to a deductible and will be settled at actual cost. Claims for damages will only be honored if noted at the time of delivery.
            Repairable Losses: The claim amount for repairable damage will be determined through a competitive bid process from two qualified auto body repair shops. Alternatively, if the Carrier elects, it may obtain an appraisal from an independent insurance adjustment company. The Shipper has the right to get a repair estimate from any qualified body shop; however, the Shipper also agrees to get a repair estimate from an auto body shop that the Carrier chooses in the state of shipment destination. The Carrier may, at its discretion, elect to accept a single bid presented by the claimant as the most cost-effective settlement available. The payment by the Carrier of any claim presented by the Shipper constitutes the full and final resolution of the claim. The Shipper releases the Carrier from any further liability involving that same vehicle upon payment of the claim.
            Total Losses: The Carrier’s liability for a total loss (where the cost of repairs exceeds the vehicle’s value) is limited to verifiable expenses, including freight charges. The Carrier is not responsible for any lost profit or diminished value.
            LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
            TK Auto Trans Inc. is not liable for:
            Damage caused by leaking fluids, battery acids, cooling systems, antifreeze solution, industrial fallout, or damage caused by acts of God, hail, or storm damage, or other force majeure events.
            Damage which is undetectable at the time due to the vehicle’s condition or weather conditions.

            Liability for Glass Damage: We are not liable for any glass damage that may escalate from previously identified pits, chips, or cracks during transport.
